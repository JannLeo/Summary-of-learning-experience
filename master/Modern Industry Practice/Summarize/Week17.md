- #### What work did you carry out that week on the mini-project?那一周你在小项目上做了什么工作?

  In this week (week 17), I have finished the task of the phase 1 draft and find 4 different project based on the different goals we want to achieve. The context summarized as follows:

  - Using muscle sensors in rehabilitation devices (Based on SDG3 : Good Health and Well-Being).
    - Research shows home rehabilitation helps stroke recovery, but current devices are costly, bulky, and need professional oversight. There's a need for affordable, compact, easy-to-use devices for home use to enhance daily rehabilitation.
  - Digital behind-the-ear hearing aid (Based on SDG 10 : reduce inequality).
    - About 90% of people with hearing loss live in low- and middle-income countries, facing more emotional challenges than those without hearing issues. Developing affordable hearing aids, which mainly consist of a microphone, receiver, and digital signal processor, is crucial to address this inequality.

  #### Is your group mini-project proceeding on schedule and is everyone making a useful contribution?你的小组小项目是否按计划进行，每个人是否都做出了有益的贡献?•

  This week I continue with the LF to finish the phase 1 draft. I mainly focus on the Projects related to selected goals we selected. And LF mainly focus on the Introduction of SDGs. ZZ and CL mainly focus on making the poster of phase 1 based on our draft.

  #### To what extent you feel that you have achieved the learning outcomes* for this module?你觉得你在多大程度上达到了本模块的学习成果* ?•

  I think this week we successfully achieve the first goal of this module, which is select the goals and find the project which is suitable for these goals. I think we are already finish about 30% of this module.

  #### Which learning experiences had the biggest impact on you and why?哪些学习经历对你影响最大，为什么?

  When I was searching paper in the network to find the suitable project for me. I found the problem of the hearing loss live in low- and middle- income countries is so serious that many child and elder cannot have hearing aids since the economic burden. It shock me a lot and I want to do something to contribute my own effort to reduce the inequality.

  #### How do you think what you have learned in this module can affect your career and professional practice going forwards?你认为你在这个模块中学到的东西会如何影响你未来的职业和专业实践?

  I think the knowledge I learned from this module not only makes me have more understanding about the modern industry but also makes me became a more caring person. It is a very meaningful module!

  #### What did you find particularly interesting that week in the lecture and online content and what are the different opinions on any emerging topic raised? 在那一周的讲座和在线内容中，你发现了什么特别有趣的地方?对于新出现的话题，你有什么不同的看法?

  This week's lecture primarily discussed the waste of resources and monopolies, narrating the rampant growth of the electronics industry and the consequent waste and pollution generated in the process. In my view, this is a vicious cycle that capitalism cannot escape, where the development of any industry inevitably follows the pattern of growth first and governance later. If we cannot break free from these shackles, then the so-called reduction of pollution and green industry are merely temporary solutions and cannot fundamentally solve the problem. We may witness the greenhouse gas emissions from chip manufacturers like TSMC and INTEL skyrocket, while those from automakers plummet. However, I do not see this as a problem. It is similar to the concerns people had three or four decades ago about overpopulation leading to insufficient food supply.





#### **Weekly Team Report - 17th Week's Summary**

1. ##### **Weekly Mini-Project Work**
   
   - In week 17, I completed the task of the phase 1 draft and found 4 different projects based on the goals we aim to achieve. The context is summarized as follows:
     - ###### Using muscle sensors in rehabilitation devices for health and well-being.
       
       - Home rehabilitation is beneficial for stroke recovery, but current devices are costly and not user-friendly, highlighting the need for more accessible solutions.
  - ###### Digital behind-the-ear hearing aid to reduce inequality.
       
       - A significant percentage of individuals with hearing loss in lower-income countries lack access to affordable hearing aids, presenting a clear inequality issue.
   
2. ##### **Group Mini-Project Progress and Contributions**
   
- This week, I collaborated with LF to complete the phase 1 draft, focusing on projects aligned with our selected goals, while LF worked on introducing the SDGs. ZZ and CL concentrated on creating the phase 1 poster based on our draft.
   
3. ##### **Achievement of Learning Outcomes**
   
- I believe we have successfully reached the first goal of this module, which involves selecting appropriate goals and identifying suitable projects. We are approximately 30% through the module’s content.
   
4. ##### **Impactful Learning Experiences**
   
- My research on the prevalence of hearing loss in low- and middle-income countries and the lack of affordable hearing aids made a profound impact on me, motivating my desire to work towards reducing this inequality.
   
5. ##### **Influence of Module Learning on Career and Practice**
   
- The insights gained from this module have broadened my understanding of the modern industry and instilled in me a greater sense of empathy, making it an invaluable experience.
   
6. ##### **Lecture Insights and Emerging Topics**
   
   - This week's lecture primarily discussed the waste of resources and monopolies, narrating the rampant growth of the electronics industry and the consequent waste and pollution generated in the process. In my view, this is a vicious cycle that capitalism cannot escape, where the development of any industry inevitably follows the pattern of growth first and governance later.
