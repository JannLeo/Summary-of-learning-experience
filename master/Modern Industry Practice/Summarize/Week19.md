- #### What work did you carry out that week on the mini-project?那一周你在小项目上做了什么工作?

- In this week (week 19), I finished the task we discussed last week with ZZ. The task is to finish the phase 2 draft of the 2.3 System Block Diagrams and 2.2 System Block Diagrams.The details of the task I finished as follows:

  - I drew the Overall Block Diagram of the entire system to explain the goals and functions of the entire system as well as the functions and implementation of the EMG system。
    - System goal: Provide more artificial intelligence-based jobs for people with disabilities and reduce hunger through drone watering
    - EMG system function: Amplify the electromyographic signal through an amplifier, and through FFT and neural network training, it can identify the electromyographic signal of different parts and use the Support vector machine to dynamically monitor the muscle fatigue status to monitor the life status of the staff.

  #### Is your group mini-project proceeding on schedule and is everyone making a useful contribution?你的小组小项目是否按计划进行，每个人是否都做出了有益的贡献?•

- We have a intense discuss about whether the draft is more important than the ppt. And finally we think we need to finish draft first so that we can write ppt easier. This week we all making a useful contribution since we all finish the task we discussed last week.

  #### To what extent you feel that you have achieved the learning outcomes* for this module?你觉得你在多大程度上达到了本模块的学习成果* ?•

  

  #### Which learning experiences had the biggest impact on you and why?哪些学习经历对你影响最大，为什么?

- When I was meeting with my teamates, I found that it is very important to know how to improve efficiency through team collaboration since most of people include me also cannot to organize a team to complete a task efficiently.

  #### How do you think what you have learned in this module can affect your career and professional practice going forwards?你认为你在这个模块中学到的东西会如何影响你未来的职业和专业实践?

  Through this week's work, I found that it is easy for any of us to finish this task individually while if we can take fully use of the teamwork we may working more effectively and achieve the effect like 1+1>2.

  #### What did you find particularly interesting that week in the lecture and online content and what are the different opinions on any emerging topic raised? 在那一周的讲座和在线内容中，你发现了什么特别有趣的地方?对于新出现的话题，你有什么不同的看法?

  摩尔定律在我看来就是对着弹孔画靶子的行为，本质上就是一个技术突然爆发使用使得其性能增长呈现指数级别。当今时代的人工智能可以类比二战期间研发的电子计算机，在二战前计算机一只都是设想，甚至是机械计算机，但是到了二战时期因为计算弹道等的需要导致电子计算机的横空出世，也正因如此全世界进入互联网时代。对于资本主义国家来说，高活力的市场力量在带来高速增长的同时也会在未来一百年左右埋下一颗经济危机的地雷。这个地雷预示着如果在那之前不能保证出现技术奇点使得进入下一个科技革命，那么这个资本主义国家就会因为贫富差距过大导致战争。所以我认为市场行为虽然适应了人类的天性，但是它是野蛮、不理性的。一个强大政府的作用虽然会导致集权，但是它会干预市场使得经济危机能够不太影响到平民的生活。根本上来说，一个人生活的意义就是活着，平安的活着享受这个过程。而不是被消费主义资本主义裹挟着去为了一些莫须有的东西奋斗一辈子。

- After listening the lecture this week, I have another point about Moore's Law and other context. Moore's Law is akin to retroactively drawing a target around a bullet hole; it essentially describes a technological eruption that leads to exponential performance growth. Today's artificial intelligence can be likened to the electronic computers developed during World War II. Before the war, computers were merely conceptual or mechanical, but the war's demand for ballistic calculations brought about the advent of electronic computers, ushering in the internet era worldwide. For capitalist nations, the vigorous market forces that drive rapid growth also plant an economic crisis time bomb that could detonate in about a century. This bomb suggests that if a technological singularity does not occur to herald the next scientific revolution, such a nation could spiral into war due to extreme wealth disparities. Therefore, I believe that while market behavior aligns with human nature, it is barbaric and irrational. The role of a strong government, although potentially leading to centralization, is to intervene in the market to ensure that economic crises minimally impact the common people's lives. Fundamentally, the essence of life is to live, to peacefully enjoy the process rather than being swept away by consumerist capitalism, struggling for lifetimes over things of no real consequence.
