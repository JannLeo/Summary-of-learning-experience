#### What work did you carry out that week on the mini-project?

- In the 22nd week, after spending the Easter holiday, I returned to the project. I began researching a large amount of online materials for Phase 3, looking for information and planning Gantt charts, and elaborately created a block diagram.

#### Is your group mini-project proceeding on schedule and is everyone making a useful contribution?

- This week, our group resumed meetings according to the plan. Firstly, we clarified the division of labor as follows:
  - LF: Responsible for researching components, materials, companies, and suppliers. Consider products from drone-related companies and discuss their services related to irrigation, as well as analyze EMG-related products in terms of cost, performance, and price.
  - CL: Responsible for procurement and summarization of materials. Summarize the materials and companies selected by LF, and handle procurement and negotiations with relevant companies.
  - Myself: Responsible for equipment production planning and Gantt chart organization. Planning the weekly tasks for our group and breaking down this large project into many smaller parts.
  - ZZ: Responsible for creating and planning the poster. Making our work visual and easier to understand.

#### To what extent you feel that you have achieved the learning outcomes for this module?

- This week, we basically completed the initial discussion of this project. Now the focus is on conducting on-site inspections, cost calculations, and time estimations to prevent the project from merely staying in the conceptual stage. This information is crucial to ensure the smooth progress of the project according to the plan, as it provides clear guidance and schedules for the team, helping them make wise decisions at each stage of the project.

#### Which learning experiences had the biggest impact on you and why?

When creating the production plan and schedule for this project, I gradually gained clarity. Before doing this, I always had some fear about the entire project. However, after completing the production plan and Gantt chart, I suddenly knew how to tackle this task. Through this experience, I realized the necessity and importance of planning for accomplishing our projects. Without a production plan and schedule, this project could very likely remain in the conceptual stage.

#### How do you think what you have learned in this module can affect your career and professional practice going forwards?

After completing the draft task for Phase 3 this week, I learned how to create a production plan and Gantt chart for a long-term project, enabling me to divide a large project into many smaller parts confidently, allowing me to face any challenges in life with greater confidence.

#### What did you find particularly interesting that week in the lecture and online content and what are the different opinions on any emerging topic raised?

In this week's lecture, one viewpoint particularly caught my interest, which is Stakeholder Capitalism. It is a business concept and economic model that emphasizes not only maximizing shareholder interests but also considering and meeting the needs and interests of other stakeholders such as employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and the environment. In my understanding, a company that exemplifies this approach well is Huawei, as it is not publicly traded, shares profits with employees annually, and offers retirement plans where employees who have worked for over 15 years and are above age 45 can retire and enjoy dividends every year, leading a worry-free life. This company truly embodies the principle of hard work paying off, focusing more on employee welfare than just monetary benefits. I believe companies like Huawei represent the future of Chinese corporations and suggest that Industrial 5.0 will likely emerge in China.

**Weekly Team Report - Summary of the 22nd Week**

In the 22nd week, following the Easter holiday break, I resumed work on the project. My focus shifted towards Phase 3, where I delved into extensive online research, gathering information, and meticulously crafting Gantt charts. Additionally, I constructed a detailed block diagram to guide our progress.

This week marked the resumption of our group meetings as planned. We promptly clarified our roles and responsibilities:
- LF: Spearheading research on components, materials, companies, and suppliers. This involved evaluating products from drone-related companies and examining EMG-related offerings in terms of cost, performance, and value.
- CL: Tasked with material procurement and summarization. Responsibilities included consolidating LF's findings and managing procurement processes and negotiations.
- Myself: Leading equipment production planning and Gantt chart organization. I focused on breaking down the project into manageable tasks and devising a structured timeline.
- ZZ: Undertaking the creation and planning of the poster, aiming to visually communicate our work effectively.

Creating the production plan and schedule provided me with newfound clarity and confidence. It transformed my initial apprehension about the project into a tangible roadmap for success. Through this process, I gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of meticulous planning in project execution. Without such planning, our project would remain stagnant in the conceptual phase.

Completing the draft tasks for Phase 3 this week was a significant milestone. It equipped me with the skills to craft comprehensive production plans and Gantt charts for long-term projects. This newfound ability empowers me to approach life's challenges with greater confidence, knowing that I can break down daunting tasks into manageable steps.

During this week's lecture, the concept of Stakeholder Capitalism particularly resonated with me. It underscores the importance of considering the interests of all stakeholders, beyond just maximizing shareholder value. Huawei serves as a notable example, prioritizing employee welfare through profit-sharing schemes and retirement plans. This ethos exemplifies a shift towards a more holistic approach to corporate governance, which I believe heralds the future of Chinese corporations and sets the stage for the emergence of Industrial 5.0.
