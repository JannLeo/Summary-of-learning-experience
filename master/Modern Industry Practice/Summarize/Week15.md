#### What work did you carry out that week on the mini-project?那一周你在小项目上做了什么工作?

This week I search a lot paper about the project we select. Mainly about the EMG sensor, Blood Pressure sensor and other technology about the body sensor. And according to these information I can conclude a summary about the phase one and give the reasons for our choice.

#### Is your group mini-project proceeding on schedule and is everyone making a useful contribution?你的小组小项目是否按计划进行，每个人是否都做出了有益的贡献?•

This week our group has strict follow the schedule to do things. First we discuss the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  and select three goals, which is the goal 2, goal 3 and goal 10. And we also divided the project to serval parts. I mainly responsible for the phase one. ZZ mainly responsible for phase two. LF mainly responsible for presentation and CL mainly responsible for phase 3.

I have learned a lot from this week's lecture. First I  knew the NVIDIA Ampere A100, launched in 2020.Since the GPU has a lot common with the AI calculation such as they all concentrate on the parallel computing to solve the matrix multiplication, thus the A100 is mainly for AI calculation, which is very interesting. Second, I  knew the Technology Roadmap, which is a important guidance and conclude the direction for the research of the future technology. The direction include the Advanced Semiconductor Process Technology, Quantum Computing, Nanoelectronics Materials, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and Bioelectronics. I think the most potential two direction are Artificial Intelligence and Bioelectronics. Because AI can reduce the time of working and Improve work efficiency and the Bioelectronics can extend our life.

And we also divided the project to serval parts. I mainly responsible for the phase one and collect the information as much as possible. ZZ mainly responsible for phase two and convey the idea to detail. LF mainly responsible for presentation to show others our subject and CL mainly responsible for phase 3 to planning and purchasing the device and plan we need.

As for me, this week I search a lot paper about the project we select. Mainly about the EMG sensor, Blood Pressure sensor and other technology about the body sensor. And according to these information I can conclude a summary about the phase one and give the reasons for our choice.

All in all, this week I also have learned a lot from this module. Because I improve the ability to communicate with my team, and have a understanding about the global technology which broaden my horizon.





改进后：

This week, our team diligently followed our schedule to accomplish tasks. We began by discussing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and selecting three goals: Goal 2, Goal 3, and Goal 10. The project was then divided into several parts:

- Phase Division:
  - Phase One: I primarily focused on gathering information.
  - Phase Two: ZZ took the lead in refining conceptual details.
  - Presentation: LF was responsible for presenting our project theme.
  - Phase Three: CL managed planning and procurement.

### Research and Development

In my role, I extensively researched technologies relevant to our project, particularly the MyoWare 2.0 EMG sensor, blood pressure sensors, and other body sensing technologies. This enabled me to summarize Phase One and justify our choices.

### Academic Insights

- **NVIDIA Ampere A100**: Discovering the A100 GPU, launched in 2020, intrigued me due to its focus on AI computing and parallel computing capabilities. We plan to utilize it for AI model training in machine learning or deep learning to identify muscle signals, aiding in disease recognition and prevention.
- **Technology Roadmap**: Understanding this roadmap's significance in guiding future technology research, particularly in artificial intelligence and bioelectronics, was enlightening. Combining these two technologies in our project shows significant potential.

### Skills and Knowledge Enhancement

This week's learning not only enhanced my team communication skills but also broadened my understanding of global technology trends. Integrating theoretical knowledge with practical projects showcases the positive impact technological innovation can have on society and individual health.
