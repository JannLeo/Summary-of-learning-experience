#### What work did you carry out that week on the mini-project?那一周你在小项目上做了什么工作?

This week I focus on the phase 1 draft text, I read a lot of the paper about the SDGs and the goals of the zero hunger, good health and well-being，reduced inequalities and so on. Finally I set the project we want to do related to these goals and finish the second part (Find specific exemplars of projects that are being carried out in pursuit of your chosen goal(s)).

#### Is your group mini-project proceeding on schedule and is everyone making a useful contribution?你的小组小项目是否按计划进行，每个人是否都做出了有益的贡献?•

This week our team discuss a lot and finally division of labour completed. I and LF are responsible for the phase 1 draft text. The ZZ and CL focus on the phase 1 poster. I think we are all doing the task according to plan and very efficient.

#### To what extent you feel that you have achieved the learning outcomes* for this module?你觉得你在多大程度上达到了本模块的学习成果* ?•



#### Which learning experiences had the biggest impact on you and why?哪些学习经历对你影响最大，为什么?

During the time when I search the paper about the reduced inequalities, I'm shocked by the climate crisis, the war in Ukraine, the weakening global economy, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. And consequently, I decided use my knowledge of electronic to create a tool or device to let more people happy. I sincerely hope the peace of the world.

#### How do you think what you have learned in this module can affect your career and professional practice going forwards?你认为你在这个模块中学到的东西会如何影响你未来的职业和专业实践?

I think the knowledge I learned from this module will significantly change the thought of my mind. I used to regard my major just a work to earn money, but now I think my skills can do other more meaningful things. It makes me study harder since now I have belief to improve the life of other people.

#### What did you find particularly interesting that week in the lecture and online content and what are the different opinions on any emerging topic raised? 在那一周的讲座和在线内容中，你发现了什么特别有趣的地方?对于新出现的话题，你有什么不同的看法?

In this week lecture, I knew the revolution is significantly connect with the war. Only after the war the world will increasingly development and generate a lot of the new technology. But most these technology were developed during the war. Wars often compel nations to allocate substantial resources to scientific and technological research to gain advantages on the battlefield. For example, during World War II, technologies such as radar, jet engines, and atomic energy saw rapid development. Also, the exigencies of war require quick solutions to practical problems, which promotes rapid iteration and application of technology. For instance, during World War II, the Allied forces' need to decrypt German Enigma machine codes accelerated the development of computer technology. 



This lecture also mentioned the Belt & Road. I'm really surprised. I believe that the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) driving economic growth across the Third World is a highly positive development. The surge in technological advancements during wartime arises from the urgent demands created by conflict, where all stakeholders, including governments, unite to address pressing needs, leading to rapid technological progress. Developing countries, representing the Third World, often require government-led initiatives with strong determination and vision to surpass developed nations in economic development. The BRI exemplifies such centralized efforts. I believe that with governmental determination akin to that demonstrated in the BRI, the current stagnation in basic scientific research can be overcome without the need for warfare. This underscores the significance of the BRI in catalysing breakthroughs for the Third World without resorting to conflict.

## Weekly Team Report - This Week's Summary

### Task Accomplishments and Focus

- This week, our efforts were concentrated on developing the Phase 1 draft text. I engaged deeply with numerous papers on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), focusing particularly on goals related to zero hunger, good health and well-being, and reduced inequalities. This intensive study guided our project's alignment with these goals and culminated in completing the second part of our assignment—identifying specific exemplar projects aligned with our selected goals.

### Project Division and Team Collaboration

- **Phase One Draft Text**: My responsibilities, alongside LF, included the meticulous drafting of Phase 1 text.
- **Phase One Poster**: ZZ and CL dedicated their efforts to crafting the Phase 1 poster.
- Our collective efforts underscore our commitment to our plan and efficiency in execution.

### Research and Insights

- Amid my research on reduced inequalities, the prevailing climate crisis, the ongoing war in Ukraine, the faltering global economy, and the persistent impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic deeply moved me. This led me to leverage my expertise in electronics towards creating tools or devices aimed at spreading happiness and fostering global peace.
- To reduce the hunger all over the world, I propose using the UAVs to achieve the Precision Agriculture to Increase arable land area. The project description as follows:
  - Precision Agriculture and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
    - **Objective**: Address global hunger by optimizing the use of arable land.
    - **Approach**: Utilize UAVs for irrigation and applying machine learning algorithms to enhance crop yield. For instance, in sunflower fields, drones have achieved up to 91% efficiency in weed detection and eradication, thus boosting crop yield.
    - **Significance**: This project underscores the role of technology in transforming agriculture, making it more efficient and sustainable, especially in regions reliant on rainfall for farming.

### Personal Growth and Academic Learnings

- The knowledge acquired through this module has profoundly transformed my perspective. My major, previously viewed merely as a means to financial ends, now represents a conduit for meaningful contributions to society. This realization has invigorated my academic pursuits, driven by a newfound purpose to enhance the quality of life for others.
- This week's lecture drew a significant connection between technological revolutions and warfare, highlighting how post-war periods often herald rapid technological advancements developed out of wartime necessities. Such historical insights emphasize the role of conflict in precipitating technological progress, albeit underscoring a preference for peaceful advancements.

### Reflecting on Global Initiatives

- The lecture's mention of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) resonated with me, affirming my belief in its positive impact on fostering economic growth within the Third World. It exemplifies how concentrated efforts led by determined governments can overcome the stagnation in basic scientific research without resorting to conflict, thereby offering a peaceful pathway to technological and economic breakthroughs for developing nations.
