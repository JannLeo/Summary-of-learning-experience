- #### What work did you carry out that week on the mini-project?那一周你在小项目上做了什么工作?

- In this week (week 18), I have read many papers and have a fully understand about three projects, and then we have a discuss about which project we should select. 

  #### Is your group mini-project proceeding on schedule and is everyone making a useful contribution?你的小组小项目是否按计划进行，每个人是否都做出了有益的贡献?•

- We have a intense discuss about which subject we should to select to continue. There are three projects illustrated below:	

  - #### Precision Agriculture and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

    - LF sincerely want to select this project since he is familiar with the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.
    - Furthermore, this project can achieve the goal of "Zero hunger".
    - However, this project cannot address the goal of "Good Health and Well-being" and "Reduced Inequalities".

  - #### Using muscle sensors in rehabilitation devices.

    - I think this project is best in three projects since it does can have connect with the three goals.
    - Furthermore, I am also familiar with EMG sensor.
    - However, ZZ think this project cannot address the problem of Inequalities.

  - #### Digital behind-the-ear hearing aid

    - ZZ and CL think it is best to choose this project since it is easy to implement.
    - However, It cannot solve the problem of hunger directly.

- Finally we decided to do a project named using EMG sensors to help people with disabilities control drones. And the below is our division of subject for phase2:

  - JN(me): Responsible for System Block Diagrams and part of ppt and presentation.
  - ZZ: Responsible for System Explanation and part of ppt and presentation.
  - LF and CL:  Responsible for Selected Technology and its Importance and part of ppt and presentation.

  #### To what extent you feel that you have achieved the learning outcomes* for this module?你觉得你在多大程度上达到了本模块的学习成果* ?•

  

  #### Which learning experiences had the biggest impact on you and why?哪些学习经历对你影响最大，为什么?

- When I was searching the paper about these three projects, I always think it is too difficult to finish each project and consequently, I became more and more eager to learn the knowledge of the electronic subject.

  #### How do you think what you have learned in this module can affect your career and professional practice going forwards?你认为你在这个模块中学到的东西会如何影响你未来的职业和专业实践?

  I think through this module I have learned a lot. And I became more passionate about electronics major. Because my major is computer science before postgraduate, and now I no regrets at all to select this major and have more passion about learning it!

  #### What did you find particularly interesting that week in the lecture and online content and what are the different opinions on any emerging topic raised? 在那一周的讲座和在线内容中，你发现了什么特别有趣的地方?对于新出现的话题，你有什么不同的看法?

  In the lecture this week, I have find a particularly interesting point about the phase1, phase2 and phase3, which is that the phase1 is mainly about the Identification of Need and Concept Definition. The phase2 is mainly about the Preliminary System Design and Detailed Configuration Item Design, and consequently, our group should consider a effective method to carry on this project such as Scrum or Waterfall Model. As for me, I think the Scrum is more suitable for us to finish this project. And to finish the Preliminary System Design, I think I need to have a understanding about how to finish the Systems modelling for this project , which is a imminent matter for me.

### **Weekly Team Report - 18th Week's Summary**

#### **Weekly Mini-Project Work**

- In week 18, I engaged in extensive reading and gained a comprehensive understanding of three projects, leading to a detailed discussion with the team on project selection.

  - ##### Precision Agriculture and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

    - LF expressed a strong preference for this project, citing familiarity with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and its potential to address the "Zero Hunger" goal. However, concerns were raised about its relevance to "Good Health and Well-being" and "Reduced Inequalities."

  - ##### Using Muscle Sensors in Rehabilitation Devices

    - I advocate for this project as the most aligned with our objectives, noting its connection to the three goals and my familiarity with EMG sensors. ZZ, however, raised concerns about its impact on reducing inequalities.

  - ##### Digital Behind-the-Ear Hearing Aid

    - ZZ and CL favored this project for its feasibility, though it was noted that it does not directly address hunger.

- After thorough discussion, we decided to proceed with a project that utilizes EMG sensors to enable drone control for individuals with disabilities.

#### **Group Mini-Project Progress and Contributions**

- Our responsibilities for phase 2 are as follows:
  - **JN (me)**: System Block Diagrams, and portions of the presentation and PowerPoint.
  - **ZZ**: System Explanation, and portions of the presentation and PowerPoint.
  - **LF and CL**: Selected Technology and its Importance, and portions of the presentation and PowerPoint.

#### **Achievement of Learning Outcomes**

- My exploration of the three projects deepened my eagerness to master electronic subjects, reinforcing my passion for the electronics major, a shift from my original computer science background without any regrets.

#### **Impactful Learning Experiences**

- The challenge of conceptualizing each project's completion has significantly heightened my interest and dedication to learning more about electronics.

#### **Influence of Module Learning on Career and Practice**

- This module has not only broadened my knowledge base but also intensified my enthusiasm for the electronics field, affirming my decision to transition from computer science.

#### **Lecture Insights and Emerging Topics**

- This week's lecture offered intriguing insights into the phases of project development, emphasizing the importance of effective methods like Scrum or Waterfall for advancing our project. I am particularly inclined towards the Scrum methodology for its suitability to our project's needs. Additionally, the immediate challenge for me is to grasp Systems Modelling for our project, highlighting a critical area for my learning and development.
