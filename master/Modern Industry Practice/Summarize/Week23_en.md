#### What work did you carry out that week on the mini-project?

- In the 23rd week, I completed the tasks assigned to me in the group by reviewing a large amount of literature and data and wrote the draft for phase 3. The main tasks included:
  - Completion of the production planning for EMG-related equipment and selection of PCB manufacturers.
  - Selection of the corresponding microcontroller STM32, differential amplifier, and instrumentation amplifier based on the construction principle of EMG (MyoWare 2.0).
  - Selection of suitable WiFi and Bluetooth modules.
  - Designing the Gantt chart for all installation stages of the EMG-driven Quadcopter Agricultural Irrigation System.

#### Is your group mini-project proceeding on schedule and is everyone making a useful contribution?

- This week, our group held a regular meeting and discussed how to complete the final report:
  - LF: Responsible for compiling and collecting data for the final report and summarizing the conclusion section.
  - CL: Responsible for compiling and collecting data for the final report and summarizing the conclusion section.
  - Me: Responsible for formatting and organizing the final report and summarizing the conclusion section.
  - ZZ: Summarizing the conclusion section.

#### To what extent you feel that you have achieved the learning outcomes for this module?

- Through this summary, we found that we have generally achieved the objectives of this module and have successfully completed the tasks related to selecting a project topic, preliminary preparation work, theoretical analysis, mid-term manufacturing plans, and Gantt chart.

#### Which learning experiences had the biggest impact on you and why?

Through this summary, I realized that within these three months, we have actually completed a major project. I suddenly feel that handling formal projects is not as difficult as I initially thought.

#### How do you think what you have learned in this module can affect your career and professional practice going forwards?

After completing the content of the manufacturing plan in the third part of the draft, I gradually understand how a project transitions from a theoretical viewpoint to practical work planning. I have gained a better understanding of the requirements and procurement plans for EMG-related equipment and have learned that testing a device must be approached from a holistic or partial perspective. For example, in the manufacturing of EMG equipment, we must first study how mature solutions like MyoWare 2.0 are completed. Based on the test results of this device and the amplifier models used, we can then purchase equipment accordingly to build, thus reducing production costs as much as possible.

#### What did you find particularly interesting that week in the lecture and online content and what are the different opinions on any emerging topic raised?

One viewpoint in this week's lecture particularly caught my interest, which mentioned that to achieve a company culture that is equal, diverse, and inclusive, recruitment should not focus on issues like skin color or nationality but should involve personality tests like MBTI to assess the suitability for a position based on personality traits. This method can help in screening suitable employees based on character and facilitate finding the right candidates more effectively and efficiently.







### **Weekly Team Report - 23rd Week's Summary**

In the 23rd week, I completed the tasks assigned to me in the group by reviewing a large amount of literature and data and wrote the draft for phase 3. The main tasks included:

- Completion of the production planning for EMG-related equipment and selection of PCB manufacturers.
- Selection of the corresponding microcontroller STM32, differential amplifier, and instrumentation amplifier based on the construction principle of EMG (MyoWare 2.0).
- Selection of suitable WiFi and Bluetooth modules.
- Designing the Gantt chart for all installation stages of the EMG-driven Quadcopter Agricultural Irrigation System.

This week, our group held a regular meeting and discussed how to complete the final report:

- LF: Responsible for compiling and collecting data for the final report and summarizing the conclusion section.
- CL: Responsible for compiling and collecting data for the final report and summarizing the conclusion section.
- Me: Responsible for formatting and organizing the final report and summarizing the conclusion section.
- ZZ: Summarizing the conclusion section.

After reviewing this summary, it is evident that we have effectively met the goals outlined in this module and have accomplished the tasks associated with selecting a project topic, conducting preliminary preparation work, conducting theoretical analysis, developing mid-term manufacturing plans, and creating a Gantt chart. This comprehensive approach has enabled us to navigate through each stage of the project systematically and has laid a solid foundation for its successful execution. With these milestones achieved, we are well-positioned to proceed with confidence and clarity as we move forward with the project implementation phase.

And then, after completing the content of the manufacturing plan in the third part of the draft, I gradually understand how a project transitions from a theoretical viewpoint to practical work planning. I have gained a better understanding of the requirements and procurement plans for EMG-related equipment and have learned that testing a device must be approached from a holistic or partial perspective. For example, in the manufacturing of EMG equipment, we must first study how mature solutions like MyoWare 2.0 are completed. Based on the test results of this device and the amplifier models used, we can then purchase equipment accordingly to build, thus reducing production costs as much as possible.

The lecture this week introduced an intriguing perspective that resonated with me, suggesting that creating an equal, diverse, and inclusive company culture doesn't solely rely on considering factors such as skin color or nationality during recruitment. Instead, it proposed using personality assessments like the MBTI to evaluate candidates based on their individual traits. This approach offers a promising strategy for screening potential employees based on their character, thus streamlining the hiring process and ensuring a better fit between candidates and positions within the organization. By focusing on personality traits rather than superficial characteristics, companies can foster an environment where diversity is celebrated and individuals are valued for their unique strengths and contributions.
