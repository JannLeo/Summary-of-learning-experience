  License: This code is public domain but you buy me a beverage if you use this and we meet someday.
  This code was adapted from the MyoWare analogReadValue.ino example found here:
  https://github.com/AdvancerTechnologies/MyoWare_MuscleSensor

  This example streams the data from a single MyoWare sensor attached to ADC A0.
  Graphical representation is available using Serial Plotter (Tools > Serial Plotter menu).

  *Only run on a laptop using its battery. Do not plug in laptop charger/dock/monitor.

  *Do not touch your laptop trackpad or keyboard while the MyoWare sensor is powered.

  Hardware:
  SparkFun RedBoard Artemis (or Arduino of choice)
  USB from Artemis to Computer.
  Output from sensor connected to your Arduino pin A0

  This example code is in the public domain.

{  
  int sensorValue = analogRead(A0); // read the input on analog pin A0

  Serial.println(sensorValue); // print out the value you read
